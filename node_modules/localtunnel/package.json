No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.\n\nGreat for working with browser testing tools like browserling or external api callback services like twilio which require a public url for callbacks.\n\n## installation ##\n\n```\nnpm install -g localtunnel\n```\n\nThis will install the localtunnel module globally and add the 'lt' client cli tool to your PATH.\n\n## use ##\n\nSuper Easy! Assuming your local server is running on port 8000, just use the ```lt``` command to start the tunnel.\n\n```\nlt --port 8000\n```\n\nThats it! It will connect to the tunnel server, setup the tunnel, and tell you what url to use for your testing. This url will remain active for the duration of your session; so feel free to share it with others for happy fun time!\n\nYou can restart your local server all you want, ```lt``` is smart enough to detect this and reconnect once it is back.\n\n## API ##\n\nThe localtunnel client is also usable through an API (for test integration, automation, etc)\n\n```javascript\nvar localtunnel = require('localtunnel');\n\nvar client = localtunnel.connect({\n    // the localtunnel server\n    host: 'http://localtunnel.me',\n    // your local application port\n    port: 12345\n});\n\n// when your are assigned a url\nclient.on('url', function(url) {\n    // you can now make http requests to the url\n    // they will be proxied to your local server on port [12345]\n});\n\nclient.on('error', function(err) {\n    // uh oh!\n});\n```\n\n## other clients ##\n\nClients in other languages\n\n*go* [gotunnelme](https://github.com/NoahShen/gotunnelme)\n\n## server ##\n\nSee shtylman/localtunnel-server for details on the server that powers localtunnel.\n\n## License ##\nMIT\n",
